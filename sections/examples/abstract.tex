    Reproducing bugs is difficult. In areas such as application development,
    developers often encounter errors reported by users. They often have to rely
    on the report logs uploaded by the user to try to reproduce these failures.
    Unfortunately, bugs are usually not reproduced such faithfully. This is
    mainly because the execution of a program is always accompanied by many
    non-deterministic events. The recording of these non-deterministic events is
    an effective way to address this issue. Meanwhile, it is noticeable that
    system calls are the primary source of non-deterministic events, hence we
    need to capture these system calls.
    
    In this thesis, I developed a system call capturing tool. This tool utilizes
    Linux Tracepoint to record system calls across the entire system, or
    fitlering by user-determined constraints, with low overhead and transparent
    trapping. 
    
    To demostrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of my research. I
    evaluate it with real-world bugs and compare it with the state-of-the-art
    systems.
