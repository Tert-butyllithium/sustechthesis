\TheName is a part of another project. Thanks to my collaborators, including Yiming Zhang, Wenxuan Shi, Yuxin Hu, and Xueying Zhang. I have learned a lot from the project. Besides, Yiming has also raised many issues for \TheName, which makes \TheName better.

I would like to express my gratefulness to my advisor, Dr. Fengwei Zhang, for his continuous support and encouragement during my college life in SUSTech.  Dr. Zhang's encouragement has rekindled my passion for research and eventually motivated me to continue on my research path. Dr. Zhang provided a lot of time to discuss with me when I was facing difficulties in research and life.

I am very appreciative to Dr. Zhenyu Ning for his guidance in our project. Dr. Ning's insightful and critical suggestions are an essential factor in making this project successful. Dr. Ning's enthusiasm, modest and gentle, has also influenced me in my life and research.

Moreover, I would like to thank all the group members in COMPASS Lab. In the last year of my college life, I was in COMPASS Lab and had an unforgettable experience.

Also, I deeply appreciate to my girl friend, who has been absent for 21 years of my life. Therefore I can only focus on my work.
